## Debugging and REPL

### Debugging

Modern versions of node.js have built-in inspector capabilities.

Run Actionhero with node's `--inspect` flag, ie: `node ./node_modules/.bin/actionhero --inspect start`

More info about new [node inspector](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector)

### REPL

```bash
actionhero console

Running "console" task

```

Actionhero has a command-line interface called a REPL! This means you can spin up a new instance of Actionhero and manually call all the methods on the `api` namespace. This combined with the new RPC tools make this a powerful debugging and development tool. Running `actionhero console` will load up a version of Actionhero in your terminal where you have access to the `api` object. This version of the server will `boot`, `initialize`, and `start`, but will skip booting any `servers`. You will be connected to any databases per your initializers.

The REPL will:

- source `NODE_ENV` properly to load the config
- will connect to redis and load any user-defined initializers
- will load any plugins
- will **not** boot any servers

If you are familiar with rails, this is very similar to `rails console`
