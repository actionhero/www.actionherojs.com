## Building for Production

(see `./bin/deploy`)

The master branch of this repository is automatically built and pushed to the `gh-pages` branch of this project by Circle.CI on a successful test run.  We statically host this project on www.actionherojs.com via github pages.

## Linting

We use [standard.js](https://standardjs.com) to manage our lint rules.  We run `standard` as part of our test suite, and your contributions must pass.  Standard is *very* opinionated and inflexible such that we cannot inject our own opinions.  There are no eslint/jshint files to manage in this project.

## CSS
- we use a default boostrap CSS file
- all components provide thier own CSS inline
